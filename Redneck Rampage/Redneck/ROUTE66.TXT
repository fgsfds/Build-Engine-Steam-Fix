"Suckin' Grits on Route 66*"
----------- Developed by Sunstorm Interactive Inc.

Thanks for purchasing "Suckin' Grits on Route 66" add-on episode for
Redneck Rampage.  This file will step you through the installation process of
the Route 66 add-on episode.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing "Suckin' Grits on Route 66"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTICE!
Please note that the "Suckin' Grits on Route 66" add-on is designed and
tested for use with only the full registered version of Redneck Rampage.
Any other updates, add-ons, or patches to the original Redneck Rampage
install, may cause incompatibilities.

---------------------------
Addendum
---------------------------

While the required size for install is stated as "Around 15MB" in the manual,
the actual size is just over 20MB.

---------------------------
INSTALLING UNDER WINDOWS 95
---------------------------
To install while runnig under Windows 95, follow these steps:

1.  Insert the Route 66 CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive

2.  If you have Autoplay enabled, then the CD-ROM will spin for a few seconds
    and the setup program will start automatically.

3.  If you do not have autoplay enabled, double-click on 'My Computer', open
    the CD-ROM and double-click the setup icon.

4.  The setup program will now try to find an installed version of Redneck
    Rampage.  If setup cannot find an installed version of Redneck Rampage,
    you will be prompted to BROWSE through the directories to locate the
    Redneck Rampage install directory.  Once this directory is selected,
    click 'Next'.

5.  A window will pop up with a list of settings for the setup.  These
    settings include the group for the shortcut, location of Redneck Rampage,
    and the amount of disk space required for the installation.  If these
    settings are acceptable, click 'Next'.

6.  Then Route 66 will then be copied to your computer system.  When this
    is complete, click the "Finish" button and then you are ready to play the
    new episode!

To run Route 66, simply run the shortcut that the setup program installed.
Once Redneck Rampage starts, select the Route 66 episode.

--------------------
INSTALLING UNDER DOS
--------------------

To install while running under DOS, follow these steps:

1.  Place the Route 66 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive.

2.  From the DOS command prompt, type 'd:' and press Enter, where 'd' is the
    drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.  Next, type 'install' and press Enter.
    
3.  After a few seconds, the DOS-based Route 66 installation program will
    begin running.  The program will prompt you to enter the location in
    which you have Redneck Rampage installed.  Enter the full path in the box
    provided and hit Enter.

4.  The install program will verify that this is the correct location andthen
    begin copying files.  When the copy if complete, press Enter and then
    you are ready to play the new episode.

To run Route 66 from the DOS command prompt or from a DOS window in Windows
95, change into the directory where you have Redneck Rampage installed.
From this directory, run the Route 66 executable by typing 'route66' and then
pressing Enter.

---------------------
UNINSTALLING ROUTE 66
---------------------
If for some reason you wish to uninstall the 'Suckin' Grits on Route 66'
episode, follow these simple steps:

For DOS:  Change directories into the Redneck Rampage directory.  Type
'uninst66' and hit enter.  All the files associated with the Route 66 add-on
will be removed from your computer.

For Windows 95:  To uninstall, go to the Control Panel ->  Add/Remove
Programs, select "Route 66" and click on the Add/Remove button.  The
uninstaller only removes files installed by the installer.  Any files
created after the install, (e.g.  config files, save games, etc... ) may be
removed manually.

----------------------------
PLAYING MULTIPLAYER ROUTE 66
----------------------------
Launching a multiplayer game of any Route 66 map is very similar to the way
the regular Redneck Rampage maps are launched for multiplayer.  Follow these
simple steps:

1.  From the START menu shortcut:  There is a Route 66 Multiplayer shortcut
    accessible from your START menu.  This shortcut can be found under the
    menu START->PROGRAMS->INTERPLAY->Route 66 Multiplayer.

2.  From a DOS command prompt or DOS Window:  Change to the directory where
    you have Redneck Rampage installed.  From this directory, run the Route
    66 Multiplayer executable by typing 'route66m' and then press Enter.

3.  A few seconds after you run the shortcut or the 'route66m' program, the
    SETUP program for Redneck Rampage will launch.  From the setup program,
    choose the type of multiplayer connection you wish to use, then select
    the menu option 'Select User Level', then choose 'Change User Level
    Search Path', and type 'route66' after the backslash and hit enter.
    Next, choose 'Select User Level' and pick the level you wish to play
    from the list.

Then proceed to start the multiplayer game as you would normally.

Problems, fixes, workarounds
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you experience any problems installing "Suckin' Grits on Route 66",
read below for possible solutions and workarounds.

Q:  When I use Alt-Tab to the Windows Desktop, then switch back to Route 66.  
    A lot of the art is missing.
A:  There is a simple solution to correcting this problem.  All you need to
    do is rerun the 'route66.exe' file.

Q:  I can't get the installer to recognize my Redneck Rampage directory! What
    do I do now?
A:  First, make sure that Redneck Rampage is currently INSTALLED on your
    computer. Secondly, the installer looks for a .CFG file to verify the
    existence of Redneck on your computer, and to detect which version of
    Redneck you have. Since you cannot run Redneck without a .CFG file, the
    installer assumes you will have one.

Q:  Route 66 crashed while I was playing it!  
A:  Should this happen, it 
    will leave your Redneck Rampage game in an unstable configuration.  You 
    may not be able to play Redneck until you correct this problem. There is
    a simple solution to correcting this problem.  All you need to do is
    rerun the 'route66.exe' file.  Now you can play the new episode as normal.

Q:  The sound and animation is *very* jerky.
A:  This will happen if you run Windows 95 and have only 16MB RAM.
    On a few systems with Windows 95, it will happen no matter how much RAM
    is in your machine.  It may also happen on computers running plain DOS
    (without Windows 95) if some other program like SMARTDRV.EXE is taking
    up a lot of memory.

    The first thing to try, as mentioned in the Redneck Rampage printed
    reference card, is to restart your computer in MS-DOS mode before you
    play.

    If you continue to experience bad jerkiness problems, try to free up
    memory taken up by items in your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
    For instance, the SMARTDRV.EXE program takes up a lot of memory and
    will cause Redneck Rampage animation and sound to become jerky.
    
    If you have only 16MB RAM, may we humbly suggest that upgrading to
    32MB RAM will cost you under US$100 and will probably speed up
    several parts of Windows 95, Redneck Rampage, and many other things 
    you do with your computer.                                                                   

Q:  When I restart my computer in MS-DOS mode and try to play the game,
    I don't get any sound, and my mouse control doesn't work.
A:  If this happens, it means your computer wasn't configured properly at the 
    factory to make use of your CD-ROM drive, sound card, or mouse.  :-(  
    Unfortunately, it takes a lot of knowhow to configure all this crap 
    yourself.  See the refcard for some basic advice on getting your computer 
    set up properly.

    If you don't have the drivers and knowhow needed to set up your CD-ROM
    drive, sound card, and mouse properly under DOS, you *may* want to try
    playing in a "DOS box" under Windows 95, since Windows 95 gives you all 
    the hardware drivers you need (except you won't get CD music).  You 
    should have 32MB RAM if you'd like to try running in a "DOS box".  
    To try this, double-click the "Pighead" shortcut in the directory on 
    your hard disk where you installed Redneck Rampage.

Q:  I launch the game but it just displays a black screen and locks up.
A:  This happens on the ATI Mach32 video card with certain versions of
    ATI's VESA driver software.  If you have a Mach32, try using the VESA
    video driver that came with the video card.  (We have seen problems
    using newer versions of the VESA driver.)

    If you have a different video card, contact the video card company
    to obtain a VESA driver.  This is usually available on video card
    companies' World Wide Web and BBS sites.

Q:  This game is too dark!
A:  Adjust your monitor first, *then* press ESC and choose Options and then
    adjust the screen brightness.

Q:  My network game is giving lots of out-of-sync errors.
A:  First, turn monsters off.  Then try fewer players (6 is very fun and 
    seems optimal). 

Q:  The game plays too slowly.
A:  Make sure that in the SETUP program you set the screen size to be 
    640x480. If you set the screen to a higher resolution (like 800X600) 
    then the game will run much slower.

    Within the game, press "-" repeatedly to shrink the size of the game
    window. This will speed up play quite a bit.

Q:  I am getting a slow framerate when I play.
A:  Try turning the Ambience Off in the Sound Options from the Main Menu.  
    This will turn off the extra sounds you hear when you are walking around
    and should help speed things back up.  You can also change the amount of 
    sounds that are playing from the Setup.exe.  This should help out also.

Q:  Sometimes the game acts strangely in co-operative play.
A:  Co-op play tends to work best with four players or less.  With more 
    players you might experience bizarre side-effects, like weapons 
    disappearing, players not exploding when hit by dynamite, keys not
    spawning, etc.  Two player co-op is highly recommended as optimal, but
    four can play co-operatively with few side-effects.  Anything above
    four players is undertaken at your own risk.
