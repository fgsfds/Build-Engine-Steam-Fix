ABOUT THIS VERSION 
 
This is the final CD-ROM version of Redneck Rampage.  Thank you for
purchasing this fine game!  Please note that THIS GAME IS NOT FREE  
and we ask you to not pass copies around to your friends.  Instead,
make them buy their own damn copies of Redneck Rampage, to encourage us
to keep making great games like this in the future!

If you'd like to pass *something* around to your friends, you can grab
the free demo version by visiting Interplay's World Wide Web site at
http://www.interplay.com.

You can also play Redneck Rampage over the Internet via Engage!
Visit http://www.engagegames.com/redneck to get the Internet-capable version
of Redneck Rampage so you can feud against rednecks even backer in the
woods than you are.
 

QUICK START -- HOW TO GET GOING 
DOS INSTRUCTIONS 

If your CD-ROM drive is a letter other than drive D: then substitute
that letter for the "D:" references in these instructions.

1.  Insert the Redneck Rampage CD-ROM.
2.  Type D:\INSTALL and then follow the on-screen instructions.
3.  After installation is complete, the SETUP program will be launched.
    Follow the on-screen instructions.  You need to configure your sound 
    card and screen size for sure, and the controller setup if you'd like 
    to configure your keys.  When you set your screen size, be sure you are 
    set to 640 x 480 or higher resolution -- we only included a 320 x 200 
    screen size for those who like to play with a smoother frame rate at 
    the expense of having to look at the whole world through smeared, 
    low-resolution beer goggles.
4.  Pick "Save & launch Redneck Rampage" to begin killing.
5.  When the game starts, hit ESC to display the menu.  Pick "New Game".
6.  After the first time you play, you can start the game by going to the 
    directory where you installed Redneck Rampage, and type RAMPAGE to start 
    playing.  For instance:

                C:
                CD \INTRPLAY\REDNECK
                RAMPAGE

If the game doesn't start up correctly, you may have an old video card
that doesn't include a VESA driver.  You'll have to load an SVGA VESA driver
(1.0 or 2.0 is fine).  Consult your video card manufacturer's manual or
web site to get the card's VESA video driver.


QUICK START -- HOW TO GET GOING 
WINDOWS 95 INSTRUCTIONS 

(Redneck Rampage was designed to be played in DOS only, *not* in a "DOS box"
in Windows 95.  These instructions will install and play the game while
making your computer restart in MS-DOS mode each time you launch Redneck
Rampage.  See the reference card and the "Troubleshooting" section below
for more details on Windows 95.)

1.  Insert the Redneck Rampage CD-ROM.
2.  Click "Install" and then follow the on-screen instructions.
3.  After installation is complete, the SETUP program will be launched.
    Follow the on-screen instructions.  You need to configure your sound 
    card and screen size for sure, and the controller setup if you'd like 
    to configure your keys.  When you set your screen size, be sure you are 
    set to 640 x 480 or higher resolution -- we only included a 320 x 200 
    screen size for those who like to play with a smoother frame rate at 
    the expense of having to look at the whole world through smeared, 
    low-resolution beer goggles.
4.  Pick "Save & launch Redneck Rampage" to begin killing.
5.  When the game starts, hit ESC to display the menu.  Pick "New Game".
6.  After the first time you play, you can start the game by inserting the
    Redneck Rampage CD-ROM and clicking the "Play" button.  Or, double-click
    the "Rampage" shortcut in the directory on your hard disk where you
    installed the game.  (If you want to try to play in a "DOS box" while
    Windows 95 is still running, use the "Pighead" shortcut instead of the
    "Rampage" shortcut.)
 
 
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 
 
MINIMUM CONFIGURATION: A Pentium P90 with 16MB RAM, a PCI or local bus SVGA 
video card, about 150 MB free space on a hard disk, and a CD-ROM drive. 
 
RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION: A Pentium P133 or faster with 32MB RAM, 
a PCI or local bus SVGA video card, about 150 MB free space on a hard disk, 
a CD-ROM drive, and a sound card with kick-ass ear-bleeding self-powered 
speakers. 
 
SUPPORTED GRAPHICS: SVGA 640x480 Minimum. SVGA 1600x1200 Maximum.   
        320x200 VGA graphics are possible but we truly don't recommend
        such an awful low-res video mode -- Redneck Rampage was designed
        with high-resolution textures for a 640x480 display.
                                                                
SUPPORTED SOUND: Gravis UltraSound, Sound Blaster/Pro/16/AWE32, Yee-Haaw, 
Oink Oink, SoundMan 16, Pro Audio Spectrum, SoundScape, WaveBlaster, Sound 
Canvas, Adlib, Disney Sound Source, and General MIDI.  All the CD music 
is played through the CD-ROM adapter of your sound card, of course.


TIPS & TRICKS

*  If you get caught in a tough spot, surrounded by enemies, use the
   moonshine and get your ass out of there.

*  Use corners effectively.  Duck behind a corner to avoid the damn-good
   shooting of Billy Ray and the Coot, then when they walk around the corner
   to find you, dump a double-load of shotgun shells into them.

*  In general, drink alcohol before eating food, to sober yourself up for
   the next time you have to hit the bottle.

*  We have heard that if you jump on the back of the truck in Taylortown
   before *any* chickens are killed on the level, you'll gain 5000 health.

*  Although you have to hit Bubba with your crowbar to end the level, 
   you should try not to kill him.  If you kill Bubba, you're screwed:
   you won't be able to end the level.  Don't do this.


NETWORK, MODEM, AND SERIAL PLAY

To start a network, modem, or serial game of Redneck Rampage, run the SETUP
program, then choose "Network Game", "Modem Game", or "Serial Game".  

NETWORK GAME (option in SETUP program)

Although Redneck Rampage supports up to 8 players in a network game,
you may need supercomputer hardware to avoid "Out of Sync" messages.
We recommend no more than 6 players, and on slower machines or slower
networks, 4 players is about as far as you should push it.

The 14 regular levels of Redneck Rampage were designed with solo and 
cooperative play in mind. Therefore, we have included 7 smaller levels
for a Pissin' Contest(tm). We recommend that you check out these levels
when you want to go on a multi-player killin' spree.

To access these levels, launch a network game and select "new game" from the
main menu. Then select Episode 3 (Pissin' Contest) and choose a level.
When you are ready, select "start game".

Before you set up a network game for the first time, note that your 
computer needs IPX drivers installed before you begin, or you will get
the error message "IPX & NetBIOS not detected".  An IPX driver is an optional
component of Windows 95 installation, and DOS IPX drivers are also available
in the Novell NetWare client.  You will have to obtain these drivers from
another source; they are not included on this CD-ROM and we can't assist
you in getting IPX drivers or configuring your network.

Here's an explanation of the options after you choose "Network Game" in 
the SETUP program:

Change Number of Players:  Self-explanatory.   Make sure all players in
        the network game are set to the same number of players before you
        start.

Setup Network Socket Number:  All players in a particular net game must be 
        set to the same network socket number.  You should only have to 
        change this if multiple Redneck Rampage games are happening on the 
        same network, so the games don't interfere with each other.

Setup Macros:  Lets you customize your text taunts you can send by hitting
        Shift-F1 through Shift-F10 while playing.

RTS File Selection:  Lets you customize your shouted taunts you can send
        by hitting Alt-F1 through Alt-F10 while playing.  If you have made  
        or received a different RTS file, this option lets you hear the 
        different taunts.

User Level Selection:  All players in a net game must be set to the same
        user level selection.  Chooses what level you want to play.

Change Player Name:  Type in your name, peckerhead!

Launch Redneck Rampage:  When everyone has correctly set their "Number of
        Players", "Network Socket Number", and "User Level" so these numbers
        agree on all systems, everyone should choose "Save and Launch Redneck 
        Rampage" to begin playing.


MODEM GAME (option in SETUP program)

Here's an explanation of the options after you choose "Modem Game" in 
the SETUP program:

Already Connected:  Tells the SETUP program you are already connected
        with your opponent and don't need to dial or pick up the phone.

Wait for Call:  Tells the SETUP program you are going to wait for your
        opponent to call you.

Dial your Opponent:  Tells the SETUP program you are going to dial your
        opponent.

Setup COM port:  Lets you specify which COM port your modem is on, and what
        speed it runs at.

Setup Modem:  Lets you specify what brand of modem you have.  Be sure to
        set up this option correctly before you begin a modem game.
        Note that you should not need to change the other initialization
        options on the "Setup Modem" screen.

Setup Macros:  Lets you customize your text taunts you can send by hitting
        Shift-F1 through Shift-F10 while playing.

RTS File Selection:  Lets you customize your shouted taunts you can send
        by hitting Alt-F1 through Alt-F10 while playing.  If you have made  
        or received a different RTS file, this option lets you hear the 
        different taunts.

User Level Selection:  Both players in the modem game must be set to the 
        same user level selection.  Chooses what level you want to play.

Change Player Name:  Type in your name, peckerhead!

Phone Number List:  To tell the SETUP program what number to dial, choose  
        this option.  Use the arrow keys to go to an empty entry and press
        E to edit that entry.  Type your opponent's name and phone number,
        then press Enter to select that phone number to dial.

Launch Redneck Rampage:  When both players have correctly set their "User 
        Level" to the same level, and one player has chosen "Wait for Call"
        and the other has chosen "Dial your Opponent" and entered the
        correct phone number, both players can choose "Save and Launch 
        Redneck Rampage" to begin playing.


SERIAL GAME (option in SETUP program)

Here's an explanation of the options after you choose "Serial Game" in 
the SETUP program:                                      

Setup COM port:  Lets you specify which COM port you are going to communicate
        on, and at what speed.

Setup Macros:  Lets you customize your text taunts you can send by hitting
        Shift-F1 through Shift-F10 while playing.

RTS File Selection:  Lets you customize your shouted taunts you can send
        by hitting Alt-F1 through Alt-F10 while playing.  If you have made  
        or received a different RTS file, this option lets you hear the 
        different taunts.

User Level Selection:  Both players in the serial game must be set to the 
        same user level selection.  Chooses what level you want to play.

Change Player Name:  Type in your name, peckerhead!

Launch Redneck Rampage:  When both players have correctly set their "User 
        Level" and the speed of their COM ports to the same speed, both 
        players can choose "Save and Launch Redneck Rampage" to begin playing.


TROUBLESHOOTING

Q:  The sound and animation is *very* jerky.
A:  This will happen if you run Windows 95 and have only 16MB RAM.
    On a few systems with Windows 95, it will happen no matter how much RAM
    is in your machine.  It may also happen on computers running plain DOS
    (without Windows 95) if some other program like SMARTDRV.EXE is taking
    up a lot of memory.

    The first thing to try, as mentioned in the printed reference card,
    is to restart your computer in MS-DOS mode before you play.  You can
    do this automatically by double-clicking the "Rampage" shortcut located
    in the "Redneck" directory on your hard disk.  The additional memory 
    freed up by the absence of Windows 95 should let the game play much 
    faster.

    If you continue to experience bad jerkiness problems, try to free up
    memory taken up by items in your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
    For instance, the SMARTDRV.EXE program takes up a lot of memory and
    will cause Redneck Rampage animation and sound to become jerky.
    
    If you have only 16MB RAM, may we humbly suggest that upgrading to
    32MB RAM will cost you under US$100 and will probably speed up
    several parts of Windows 95, Redneck Rampage, and many other things 
    you do with your computer.                                                                   

Q:  When I restart my computer in MS-DOS mode and try to play the game,
    I don't get any sound, and my mouse control doesn't work.
A:  If this happens, it means your computer wasn't configured properly at the 
    factory to make use of your CD-ROM drive, sound card, or mouse.  :-(  
    Unfortunately, it takes a lot of knowhow to configure all this crap 
    yourself.  See the refcard for some basic advice on getting your computer 
    set up properly.

    If you don't have the drivers and knowhow needed to set up your CD-ROM
    drive, sound card, and mouse properly under DOS, you *may* want to try
    playing in a "DOS box" under Windows 95, since Windows 95 gives you all 
    the hardware drivers you need (except you won't get CD music).  You 
    should have 32MB RAM if you'd like to try running in a "DOS box".  
    To try this, double-click the "Pighead" shortcut in the directory on 
    your hard disk where you installed Redneck Rampage.

Q:  I launch the game but it just displays a black screen and locks up.
A:  This happens on the ATI Mach32 video card with certain versions of
    ATI's VESA driver software.  If you have a Mach32, try using the VESA
    video driver that came with the video card.  (We have seen problems
    using newer versions of the VESA driver.)

    If you have a different video card, contact the video card company
    to obtain a VESA driver.  This is usually available on video card
    companies' World Wide Web and BBS sites.

Q:  This game is too dark!
A:  Adjust your monitor first, *then* press ESC and choose Options and then
    adjust the screen brightness.

Q:  There's an awful lot of profanity in this game.
A:  Really?  For even more, visit www.interplay.com and get the Cuss! Pack.
    If such terrible language is too much for you, you can press ESC, choose
    Options, and then choose "Parental Lock" (and optionally lock the game
    into Parental Lock mode with a password).  This will screen out the
    blood gibs and *some* of the profanity.

Q:  My network game is giving lots of out-of-sync errors.
A:  First, turn monsters off.  Then try fewer players (6 is very fun and 
    seems optimal). 

Q:  The game plays too slowly.
A:  Make sure that in the SETUP program you set the screen size to be 
    640x480. If you set the screen to a higher resolution (like 640x480) 
    then the game will run much slower.

    Within the game, press "-" repeatedly to shrink the size of the game
    window. This will speed up play quite a bit.

Q:  I do not receive CD Audio from the Redneck Rampage disc or any other CD.
A:  There is a problem with Mitsumi CD ROMS.  If you are playing in Windows 
    95 we suggest that you take advantage of the CD Player in Windows.  If
    you are in DOS we suggest that you launch the CD utility that comes with
    most major sound cards.

Q:  I am getting a slow framerate when I play.
A:  Try turning the Ambience Off in the Sound Options from the Main Menu.  
    This will turn off the extra sounds you hear when you are walking around
    and should help speed things back up.  You can also change the amount of 
    sounds that are playing from the Setup.exe.  This should help out also.

Q:  Sometimes the game acts strangely in co-operative play.
A:  Co-op play tends to work best with four players or less.  With more 
    players you might experience bizarre side-effects, like weapons 
    disappearing, players not exploding when hit by dynamite, keys not
    spawning, etc.  Two player co-op is highly recommended as optimal, but
    four can play co-operatively with few side-effects.  Anything above
    four players is undertaken at your own risk.


PLAYING CD MUSIC

If you're playing in MS-DOS mode like you should, you can access the
digital 8-track tape by hitting ESC, then choosing OPTIONS, and then choosing
SOUNDS and then 8-TRACK.  The space bar will turn it on and off; use the 
arrow keys to change tracks.  The 8-track player will not work if Windows 95 
is in memory.

If you eject a CD while playing the game, the 8-track unit will be disabled 
until you quit and run the game again.  A music CD (not necessarily the
Redneck Rampage CD) must remain in the CD-ROM drive at all times for music
to work.  Remember, this is an 8-track player, so if you have fancy CD's
with more than 8 music tracks, yer out of luck.  Your mileage will also
vary if the 8 music tracks on your CD vary at all from the times of all
the tracks on the Redneck Rampage CD!

Finally, you can pop the Redneck Rampage CD into your audio CD player and
relax to the soothing tunes of Mojo Nixon, the Beat Farmers, the Reverend
Horton Heat, and Cement Pond -- just skip past track 1 before the soothing,
blasting static of computer data blows out your speakers.
